                    On the night of December 25, 1996, a man broke into the Ramsey's home and killed an American child beauty queen 
                    JonBenét Patricia Ramsey. Her body had been found after several hours by her father when he checked their basements 
                    to try and find clues. She had sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled. Her killer 
                    would never be found due to serious infractions in the forensic process.

                        Originally a lot of false, unsubstantiated suspicion was put on JoBennets parents. The main cause of this suspicion 
                        was the lack of evidence to lead any type of investigation. Although they were never officially declared suspects 
                        in the case the media always portrayed them as such leaving a very negative opinion of them through many years of their lives.

                        In 2006 John Mark Karr was arrested in Bangkok, Thailand, after a confession to the murder of JonBenét. Early on 
                        there was a severe lack of evidence that Jhon Karr had committed this crime. From his drugging claims of the 
                        victim to not being able to even prove he was in boulder during the time, The cases ended up going nowhere.

                        In 2006 CNBC published a documentary covering the case of JonBenét Ramsey. This documentary, however, did 
                        not rely on actual evidence but rather on dramatization. This led the Documentary to name the main suspect 
                        Burke Ramsey. He would later sue for defamation and received an undisclosed amount.

                There were several very serious issues when it comes to the forensic investigation that this case seemingly ignored. 
                Firstly, the police officers didn't immediately close the entire house as a way to preserve as much evidence as possible 
                but rather only JoBennet's room since they believed it was the only place with evidence. To add insult to injury they l
                et friends and family members roam freely around the house and clean up as they believed there was nothing wrong with this. 
                The police officers also took around 7 hours to interview the parents, an incredibly long time for something this important. 
                Once the father found the body, he also rapped it in a sheet, destroying possible forensic evidence.

            <h1 class="display-4">Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="lead">This case goes to show us just how important following the steps to forensic investigation. It has been more than 
              24 years without giving any type of resolution for two parents who lost their child. 24 years of complete uncertainty and without 
              closure. The closure which more than likely they would have been able to have if the steps had just been followed carefully. This 
              truly is a heartbreaking case. But it just goes to show the importance of being a good forensic investigator and being competent in your job.
